  <para><emphasis>This license, but not the licensed product, is licensed to &quot;the LCPL Development Team&quot; under LPCL.</emphasis></para>
  <para>The intention of this license is to provide a means to release a product in a community without any particular user governing the project. In particular, the license should encourage the liberties taken in wiki systems, provide a means to settle disputes, and allow new users to continue a project where every developer has gone inactive. This license imposes NO restrictions on work that is released under other names than the name of this product. If such restrictions are desired, the work may be licensed under more than one license.</para>

    <title>Definitions.</title>
    <para>&quot;This product&quot; refers to all work licensed under this license. A &quot;derivative work&quot; is any copyrightable material based on or using this product. &quot;The community of this product&quot; is a body of entities, usually people, which may be defined in an accompanying policy document or section as stated below.</para>
    <para>A separate document or section defining this product&apos;s community and policy may accompany this license and is treated as constituent of the referenced product as far as this license is concerned. Such a document or section may only define &quot;the community&quot; and how &quot;the community&quot; may exercise Clause 3.2 of this license. In particular, changing such a document does not demand a new release of this license but it does demand a new release of the product. If no such document or clause accompanies the product, then &quot;the community&quot; is the empty set.</para>
