  <title>Prototyping phase</title>
  <para>Following prototypes were made in project progress</para>
  <section>
    <title>Prototype 1, world map</title>
    <para>Because exploration was picked as one of more important features, and adding features to game works better when game world is already here, it was decided that we start with prototyping game world display.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Iteration 1, small hand made area</title>
      <para>This iteration is very small, warm-up activity.</para>
      <para>Our aim here is to adjust tile size and scrolling speed, also to see how designed view will behave in practice.</para>
      <para>We should create part of world view, using only temporary tiles for now. Map should have different tile types and user should be able to scroll it at least one screen up, down, left or right in fluid, pixel based manner. Projection used should be trimetric, tile size could be around 1/8 of screen height and scrolling whole screen should take about 2 seconds.</para>
      <para>For now we can assume 800x600 in windowed mode.</para>
      <section>
        <title>Results</title>
        <para>Most works on the prototype was done by <emphasis>willurd</emphasis> with support from <emphasis>bartbes</emphasis>. They spent lots of time on this one, and created even more than described here. Description was extended with zoom functionality that allowed to test/simulate look with different resolutions and editor features for making map creation easier. First iteration can be marked as success. Work on this iteration started at 18th March and ended at 21st March.</para>

      <title>Iteration 2, here comes our hero</title>
      <para>This iteration will add scale to world, foliage and road sign, but most important - it will add the hero. This time we will try to make the character move around and catch proper proportions.<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Scale</emphasis> - lets for now assume for need of this prototype, that tile as we have it now, have side of 2 meters, making it screen height about 18 meters - lets create character with height of about 60 pixels. We should have 8 sprites for now of character facing 8 different directions. Character could be made of cone or cylinder, with somehow marked direction it&apos;s pointing.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Character movement</emphasis> - character movement should be fluent, for now no collisions are needed, let&apos;s assume that walking from bottom to top of screen should take about 4 seconds running, 8 walking and 16 sneaking. For the prototype it should be enough to implement one speed, say running. We should use two methods of walking, one based on a keyboard, second by using a mouse.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Foliage and sign</emphasis> - let&apos;s create simple higher brush grass asset to place around - reaching character&apos;s knees and one road sign a bit higher than character. Purpose of this is to test out drawing order and stuff assets placement, no collisions required yet. Assets should be placed on a pixel based manner, i.e., it should be possible to place sign on left or right part of certain tile.</para>

        <title>Important events during iteration 2</title>
        <para>During this phase project had hard days. After some work, most people had troubles finding time to work. It resulted in long break. After this, project had to be refreshed. To bring new life to it again, some decisions were made.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>We moved to GitHub, so more people can contribute.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>We welcomed a new Developer and issued one promotion to Lead Developer role.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>We implemented new ticketing system using GitHub labels.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>First developer meeting was held (on 1st August 2010, 15:00-16:00 GMT), with some important decisions made:</para>
            <para><itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>We restrict the way community can force in destructive changes to current project, it is no longer possible to force developers to change nearly finished game and rewrite all of it, even if 100% of community wants it and provides patches, unless developers agree to this. It was necessary to protect developers work, who gave a lot of themselves to project.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>It was decided to prepare description of next iterations of prototype 1, and some sketch of what they could be was made.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Based on prepared iterations for prototype one, we will prepare open task-tickets for community to take on, giving some directions to potential contributors.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Finally, it was decided to repeat meeting, probably during next week.</para>
                </listitem>

      <title>Iteration 3, start bumping into things</title>
      <para>After previous iteration, the world will have already proper scale, hero and some foliage and road signs. This iteration will concentrate on collisions.</para>
      <para>We should add some larger stones, a tree with big trunk and (currently closed, probably very similar to a box) house. Different things that will stop our hero from movement.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Iteration 4, Willma - I&apos;m home</title>
      <para>With all this done, we will open the previously added house. Add ability to enter it and move around. The building should still have only one floor available. We should decide how to show the interior. For this prototype, the building can be empty box with holes for windows or doors. Proper doors will be added in later prototypes, when working on interactions.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Iteration 5, Stairway to Heaven</title>
      <para>When character will have freedom to walk around on the map and into buildings, we will add stairs to second floor, and probably basement too. We need to make sure, that the transition of view between floors works, especially while still on stairs, and that collisions are working too, so character does not get stuck. Both keyboard and mouse movement should work.</para>
